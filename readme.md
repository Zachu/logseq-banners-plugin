## Logseq Banners plugin
Enliven your Logseq Workspace with gorgeous, custom, Notion style page banners and icons
![](screenshots/main.png)

## Instructions
* Install the plugin from the Logseq plugin marketplace
* Configure a default images and icons in "Settings -> Plugin Settings -> Banners"
* Customize the banner image on a per page basis via the page props:
    * `banner:: https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1146672.jpg`
* To avoid Logseq show banner preview in props area - wrap it with doublequotes!
    * `banner:: "http://........"`
*  Sometimes important banner parts cropped on default vertical align "50%" (center), so you can do fine tune with page props:
    * top: `banner-align:: 0%`
    * bottom: `banner-align:: 100%`
* Customize the page icon on a per page basis via the page props:
    * `page-icon:: üí∏`
    * or use native Logseq `icon:: üí∏`

## Customization
* All customizations (a lot!) can be done from plugin settings ("Settings -> Plugin Settings -> Banners") in nice grouped blocks:
    * Hide plugin related page props for more clean view
    * Widgets HTML embed code
    * Widget calendar size
    * Separate settings for journals and common pages
    * Banners and icons default sizes
    * Banners and icons default vertical align
* Example for adwanced settings (JSON) for custom page types: "Settings -> Plugin Settings -> Banners -> Adwanced settings -> Advanced custom pages banners and icons config -> Edit settings.json"
